        Content: `During my 6-month internship at Capgemini engineering, I had to develop a web software that could be used to manage user's data easily. These ones were related to the 3DExperience platform, a Dassault System environment used by many companies for many applications like 3D design, document storage, project collaboration and communication.

By following a Scrum-Agile method, this project was also for me an opportunity to increase my communication skills by describing my progress on the project every sprint reviews. Then I've also managed a small marocain team working with me during a short period.

Because it is a professional project, I can't divulgate any important information about this one, but the main goal of this web app was to make administrators winning a lot of time when they needed to modify a big amount of data quickly. So, the main subject was data selection, visualization, and import/export in different formats.`

These kinds of projects, even if they are a little bit less inside the computer sciences field, permit me to learn how to lead a project and get a global vision of it while maintaining a long - term motivation and avoid mistakes.`

This one is more elaborated and professional than Distory, my first composing project. This 9-song project is also accompanied by a professional web site made by me, and a better and more professional production, and commercialization.

For this album, I wanted some better records, so I went in a musical studio to record my voice with a sound engineer.

This entire project was an opportunity for me to learn more about the professional music world, and how to complete a huge project with the most details possible.`

        Content: `For my last semester I made at the University of Technology of Troyes, we had to create in group a software regarding some specifications :
    - Use 5 different web services.
    - Use a certain number of design patterns (kind of "good habit" in programming).
    
With my group, we made a web app using react for the frontend and expressJS/MSSQL for the backend proposing some french museums or arts to visitors.

Because I've already worked a lot on Angular and React environment at Capgemini, I wanted to get more knowledges in security within the backend part, a subject that I didn't have the time to explore during my internship.

So, I worked on the users' data, and the way to secure a connection to our web app, using Java web tokens, and credentials encryption and verification on MSSQL.

The goal of my part was to deliver the project the most secured and professional possible.

        Content: `After my internship at Capgemini, I've had a free month before starting my next course semester. I took this time to work on a smaller project regarding graphic visualization.
        
I learned a lot about different technologies like JS Canvas, and some frameworks like threeJS, openGL...

Then I decided to create a web fractal generator. The goal was to use more maths inside computer sciences, because I'm still really passionate in this field.

I've always been intrigued by fractals, and specially on the Mandelbrot fractal, maybe the most popular one. This tool is a Mandelbrot Fractal generator, which allows the user to modify some properties on the visualization like the Mandelbrot formula, colors, resolution.

Because that's a web visualization, this one is lagging a lot contrary to a python visualization which would be much more faster. To reduce lags, I implemented some shaders to separate workload in multi-thread by using JS Workers.

Finally, with the release of ChatGPT that revolutionated a part of our society, I experimented this really powerful technology for the first time in computer sciences to learn faster about these visualization tools and to implement my project easier.`

We also learned to use a GitHub repository in group, to work together and document well our project.`
