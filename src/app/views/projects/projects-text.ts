        Content: `During my 6-month internship at Capgemini engineering, I had to develop a web software that could be used to manage user's data easily. These ones were related to the 3DExperience platform, a Dassault System environment used by many companies for many applications like 3D design, document storage, project collaboration and communication.

By following a Scrum-Agile method, this project was also for me an opportunity to increase my communication skills by describing my progress on the project every sprint reviews. Then I've also managed a small marocain team working with me during a short period.

Because it is a professional project, I can't divulgate any important information about this one, but the main goal of this web app was to make administrators winning a lot of time when they needed to modify a big amount of data quickly. So, the main subject was data selection, visualization, and import/export in different formats.`

These kinds of projects, even if they are a little bit less inside the computer sciences field, permit me to learn how to lead a project and get a global vision of it while maintaining a long - term motivation and avoid mistakes.`

This one is more elaborated and professional than Distory, my first composing project. This 9-song project is also accompanied by a professional web site made by me, and a better and more professional production, and commercialization.

For this album, I wanted some better records, so I went in a musical studio to record my voice with a sound engineer.

This entire project was an opportunity for me to learn more about the professional music world, and how to complete a huge project with the most details possible.`
